 * The Laser Analytics Tiff Writer University of Cambridge (camtiff) is a
 * library designed to, given an input 16 bit 3D array and some additional
 * comments, produce a TIFF image stack. It is designed to work with a piece of
 * LabVIEW software within the Laser Analytics group codenamed Apollo, a front
 * end for acquiring spectroscopic images.
